# Redux Lite

Today we're going to be building a tool to keep track of global `state` for an application. We're going to define a "single source of truth" for any global data we want to share across our application. This source of truth will essentially be nothing more than a javascript object, but we will define a strict API for how this object can be modified. We will also implement a "subscription" feature, that will allow any other part of our application to specify a callback to be invoked whenever any changes are made to the object.

## Phase 1 - `Store`
Using ES6 class syntax, create a new class, `Store`, that will represent our global application state. The `Store#constructor` function will take a single function as an argument, `rootReducer`. The constructor function should define instance variables to store the `rootReducer` and the global `state` (an empty object for now).
We also need to have a way to read from the `state`. Define a function, `getState`, on the `Store` prototype that returns the `state` instance variable. Note: Since we want to control how the `state` can be modified , we want to make sure we don't return the **actual** `state` object, otherwise we could inadvertently modify it directly. Instead, return a copy of `this.state` using `Object.assign`.

## Phase 2 - `Reducers`, `rootReducer`, and `combineReducers`
### Reducers and Actions
Our global `state` object will store keys representing application data. `reducers` are pure functions that describe how these pieces of data will change in response to some `action`, or event. For instance, if our state looks like: 
```js
  state = {
    user: "Andy",
    role: "Instructor"
  }
```
we could define reducers, `userReducer` and `roleReducer`, that describe if/how these keys change when something happens. This "change" is referred to as an `action`. By convention, an `action` is represented by an object that describes what is happening. For instance, an action that modifies the role might look like: 
```js
  {
    type: "change role",
    newRole: "Student"
  }
```
A `roleReducer`, then, might look something like this: 
```js
  const roleReducer = (oldRole = nil, action) => {
    if (action.type === "change role") {
      return action.newRole
    } else {
      return oldRole
    }
  }
```
In the above function, we check the `type` of the incoming `action`, and then either return the `oldRole` (nothing should change), or return the new data, `action.newRole` (this key in the state should change in response to this action).
We will leave it up to the user of our tool to define their own reducers and actions, but we will make a few assumptions:
  - reducers will be pure functions (will not modify arguments), and deterministic (same output given same input)
  - reducers will always take two arguments: the previous value of the key in state (`prevState`) and and `action`
  - reducers will have a default value for their `prevState`
  - if a reducer "ignores" an `action`, it will return the unmodified `prevState`
  - if a reducer "responds" to an `action`, it will either return something completely new (data from the action) or will create a **new copy** of the `prevState` before making any changes.

## Combining Reducers
It would be pretty annoying for our users to have to call every reducer manually to update state. Instead, we'll have them provide a configuration object that describes which reducer is responsible for which key in state, and then use that object to create a single function that updates state appropriately. A sample configuration object might look like this:
```js
  {
    users: reducerForUsers,
    roles: reducerForRoles,
    bananas: reducerForBananas,
    entities: reducerForEntities
  }
```
Write a function, `combineReducers`, that accepts this configuration object as an argument and returns a single reducer. The returned reducer function should meet the same expectations that we've laid out for all reducers â€“ it should accept a `prevState` and an `action`, and return either the `prevState` (if nothing changed), or a copy of `prevState` (if something changed). 
Your reducer should use the configuration object to calculate the next value of each key in `prevState`.
To do this, you'll need to find the old value of that key, and pass it into the appropriate reducer. Finally, once you've calculated each value, return your new state object.
Once you think you have it working, call a TA over for a code review!

## Phase 3 - Dispatch
The function we wrote in the last phase allows many reducers to be combined into one. As a result, our users can create a single reducer to be responsible for the entire global state! We'll call this "master" reducer the `rootReducer`. Recall that, in the first phase, our `Store#constructor` took a `rootReducer` as an argument - our user can now use `combineReducers` to create a `rootReducer`, and then use it to create a `Store`. We'll now define a new function on the `Store` prototype, `dispatch`, to handle passing each action into this `rootReducer`. You should now be able to do the following:
```js
// define a reducer for user:
const userReducer = (oldUser = nil, action) => {
  if (action.type === "new user") {
    return action.user;
  }
  return oldUser;
};

// create a rootReducer:
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer
});

// create a store using the rootReducer:
const store = new Store(rootReducer);

// get the state:
store.getState(); // => {}

// invoke the dispatch function to update the user key:
action = {
  type: "new user",
  user: "Jeffrey Fiddler"
};

store.dispatch(action);
store.getState(); // => { user: "Jeffrey Fiddler" }
```
Notice that the first time we call `getState`, we get an empty object without a `user` key. This is not an ideal behavior since we want to avoid having to check if a key exists in our state manually every time. Instead, let's take advantage of the default value provided for the `prevState` in each reducer. Modify your `Store` class and/or your `combineReducers` function to handle this. Instead of assigning state to an empty object, assign default values for each key in state using the `rootReducer`.
Hint: You can invoke a function and pass **only** the second argument using an old fisherman's trick:
```js
const myFunction = (arg1 = "banana", arg2) => {
  if (arg1) return `arg1 is ${arg1}`;
  return `arg2 is ${arg2}`;
};

let arg2 = "test";
let args = [, arg2];
myFunction(...args); // => "arg2 is test"
```
To test your code, create a new `Store` with some rootReducer. You should be able to call `getState` immediately and see your default state! Get a code review once you have it working.

## Phase 4 - Subscribing to the store
Now we have a nice API for modifying our global state. The next step is to allow different parts of our application to "listen" for these changes, and then trigger some callback in response. To do this, we'll keep track of an array of functions called `subscriptions`. Initialize this variable in your `Store#constructor`. Next, define a `subscribe` function on the `Store` prototype that takes a callback and adds it to the array of subscriptions. 
We also want to control when those subscription callbacks get triggered. We **could** trigger them every time `dispatch` is called, but this would be a waste of resources since we could potentially have actions that don't affect state. Instead, we want to trigger the subscriptions *only* when state changes.
To do this, pass the `subscriptions` array as a third argument to `rootReducer`. Inside of `rootReducer`, think of a way to determine whether or not the given action has modified any keys in your state (Hint: what assumptions are we making about our reducers???). If it has, trigger all of the subscription callbacks and pass them the next state.

Test your code! You should be able to subscribe a callback to the store. Whenever an action triggers a state change, this callback should be triggered. However, if the action doesn't result in a state change, nothing should happen. Try the following:

```js
  const actionCreator1 = value => {
    type: "add",
    value
  }

  const actionCreator2 = value => {
    type: "subtract",
    value
  }

  const actionCreator3 = value => {
    type: "no change",
    value
  }

  const numberReducer = (num = 0, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
      case "add":
        return num + action.value;
      case "subtract":
        return num - action.value;
      default:
        return num;
    }
  }

  const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    number: numberReducer
  });

  const store = new Store(rootReducer);

  store.getState() // => { number: 0 }

  const announceStateChange = nextState => {
    console.log(`That action changed the state! Number is now ${nextState.number}`);
  }

  store.subscribe(announceStateChange);

  store.dispatch(actionCreator1(5)); // => "That action changed the state! Number is now 5"
  store.dispatch(actionCreator1(5)); // => "That action changed the state! Number is now 10"
  store.dispatch(actionCreator2(7)); // => "That action changed the state! Number is now 3"
  store.dispatch(actionCreator3(7)); // => Nothing should happen! The reducer doesn't do anything for type "no change"
  store.dispatch(actionCreator1(0)) // => Nothing should happen here either. Even though the reducer checks for the "add" action type, adding 0 to the number won't result in a state change.

  store.getState(); // => { number: 3 }

```

## Bonus 1 - Log State Changes by Applying Middleware
### Middleware
According to the redux docs, `middleware` is **some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response**. In the context of redux, middleware provides **a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer**. We'll modify our `Store` class to use middleware functions, so that we can execute some code between the moment `Store#dispatch` is invoked with an action, and when that action is eventually passed to our `Store#rootReducer` function. We'll also allow our middleware to be "chainable", meaning that we can specify an in-order list of functions to be invoked for each `dispatch`. Once we've invoked all of the provided middlewares, we'll invoke the `rootReducer` with the provided action. Like reducers, we'll make some assumptions about the format of our middleware functions:

  ```js
  // The format of a middleware function:

  const aMiddleware = store => next => action => {
    // Do whatever we want with the store
    // Do whatever we want with the action
    // Optionally invoke `next` with the provided `action`
    // to trigger the next middleware 
    // in the chain like so: `next(action)`
    // If all middlewares invoke `next`, 
    // then eventually `next` will be the `rootReducer`
  }
  ```

  In the above example, we have a function that takes the `store` as an argument and returns another function. The returned function also takes a single argument, the `next` callback and returns another function (`next` is either the next middleware in the chain, or the `rootReducer` if we're finished). Finally, this function accepts the `action`, and then does whatever the middleware is supposed to do. We can stop the `dispatch` event here if we want, or we can continue by invoking next: `next(action)`.
  If this seems like a confusing way to do this, hold on to your horses because it will all become clear in time.

### `applyMiddleware`
  Similar to `combineReducers`, we need to define a function that takes some arbitrary number of middlewares in order, and returns a single function that handles the logic of invoking each middleware, followed by an eventual callback (the rest of our normal redux cycle). The function returned from `applyMiddleware` will be passed as an argument to `createStore`, and eventually used to modify the `Store#dispatch` function. Example:

  ```js
    const appliedMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
      firstMiddleware, 
      secondMiddleware, 
      lastMiddleware
    );
    const store = createStore(rootReducer, appliedMiddleware);
  ```

  Or, alternatively:

  ```js
    const store = createStore(
      rootReducer, 
      applyMiddleware(
        firstMiddleware, 
        secondMiddleware, 
        lastMiddleware
      )
    );
  ```

  #### Part 1
  Write a function, `applyMiddleware`, that:

    - accepts a list of middleware functions (Hint: spread operator)

    - returns a function that accepts some `store` and `callback` (since we don't yet have the `store` instance or `rootReducer`) and returns another function.

    - The returned function should accept an `action` and:
      + clone the `middlewares` array (to avoid mutating between calls)

      + define an `invokeNextMiddleware` function (leave blank for now, then see below)

      + return and invoke `invokeNextMiddleware`, passing it the provided action.
  
  Use the following template for guidance:

  ```js
  const applyMiddleware = (...middlewares) => (store, cb) => action => {
    // Your Stuff
  }
  ```
  #### Part 2
  Write out the functionality of `invokeNextMiddleware`. It should remove the next middleware from the array and invoke it with all of the appropriate arguments (you should have all of them available at this point). (Hint: Pass `invokeNextMiddleware` as the `next` callback!). If there **is no** next middleware, then at this point we know we're ready to pass control back to `dispatch` and the `rootReducer`, so invoke the `callback` passed to the second function, and pass it the `action`.

  #### Part 3
  If you've made it this far, thank you. I know these directions could be made clearer and I welcome any and all advice. As mentioned earlier, we're passing the first returned function as an argument to the `Store` constructor. Save this function in an instance variable, `this.appliedMiddleware`, so that we can access it in `dispatch`. Then, modify `Store#dispatch` to incorporate it. Since we've done most of the work in `applyMiddleware`, all we have to do differently here is invoke the `appliedMiddleware` function, and pass it a `Store` instance (`this`) and any `callback` that accepts an action (perfect, right?). This callback essentially represents whatever we want to do after all of our middlewares have been invoked, which is just our normal routine from before! One last thing though, remember that this function also returns the function that takes the `action`, so, lastly, invoke the whole thing (`this.appliedMiddleware(store, cb)`) with the original `action`:

  ```js
    this.appliedMiddleware(store, cb)(action);
  ```

  #### Part 4
  Test your dank new functionality with the following simple middleware functions:

  ```js
    const middleware1 = store => next => action => {
      console.log("Middleware 1!");
      next(action);
    }

    const middleware2 = store => next => action => {
      console.log("Middleware 2!");
      next(action);
    }
  ```
  
  You should see each middleware log to the console in order each time you pass an action to dispatch.

### Writing your first middleware, `reduxLogger`
  Now that you have the ability to `applyMiddleware`, let's build a tool that logs any changes to state in the console so we can see what's going on. Write a middleware, `reduxLogger`, that logs
    - the `prevState`
    - the `action`
    - the `nextState`
  and labels them appropriately.
  Note: Getting `nextState` will be a little tricky since it will only be calculated by the `rootReducer`. However, if `reduxLogger` is **the last middleware**, we could potentially use the return value of `next(action)`. In order for this to work properly, make sure your functions are returning state in  all necessary places!
  Once you can log properly, let's make this tool even more dank by adding some color to the logged output. Javascript supports adding CSS to `console.log()`'s using the following fisherman's trick ("%c"):

  ```js
  console.log("%c This is a purple message", "color: purple")
  ```
  
  Make your output pretty, then also add some other stuff you think looks cool. Show a TA your final product.
